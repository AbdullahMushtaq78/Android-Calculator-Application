# Android-Calculator-Application Along with some scientific functions also.
Language used: Java <br/>
Third-party library: [Math Parser](https://mathparser.org/)
## Calculator Application with the following mathematical operators:
- Addition "+"
- Subtraction "-"
- Multiplication "*"
- Division "÷"
- Modulus "%"
- Factorial "!"
- Exponent "x^y"
- Square Root "√"
- Cube Root "∛"
- SIN
- COS
- TAN

-> Reset button "AC" to clear all of the equations from the display.<br/>
-> Delete "C" button to delete last entered value.<br/>
-> Decimal Numbers are also handled. <br/>
-> All of the functionalities are working fine. There's no bug in the program's calculation, input, and logic. <br/>
-> Every button works completely fine with all the checks required to take input from the user. <br/>
-> The UI has a Minimalistic and Dark mode design. <br/>
-> The input can be a very long number also. Thanks to the Math ParserX library, the help of this math parser library evaluation of expressions is very efficient and accurate. <br/>
-> My own [Post fix Expression Evaluator](https://github.com/AbdullahMushtaq78/Postfix-Expression-Calculator-Huge-Integer) is also implemented along with other code, but it has some limitations. That's why MathParser is used by default. Although the Math parser did not support some of the mathematical operators in this app, these operators are handled completely. <br/>
